The rise in computational power of quantum computers poses a significant threat to traditional cybersecurity algorithms, rendering them highly susceptible to attacks. Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) offers a promising solution by using principles of quantum mechanics such as superposition and the uncertainty principle to eliminate mathematical algorithms, thus increasing eavesdropping detection accuracy drastically. Utilizing QKD for satellites in Low Earth Orbit is key for the future of our cybersecurity as they increase efficiency by eliminating fiber repeaters and establishing multiple connections through a single satellite. The BB84 protocol is a QKD single-photon based algorithm that solves the intercept-and-resend attacks that are commonly employed by hackers. Through this study, we use three Python 3.12 simulations to explore the shortcomings of current BB84 protocol approaches for satellite applications. Furthermore, we illustrate why privacy amplification and error channel connections are essential for total cybersecurity.
